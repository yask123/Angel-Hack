# Summarize It!

Summarize it is a chat summarizer plugin for instant messaging applications. It summarizes the large content of chat logs which enables users to quickly understand the current context of the conversation. Currently Summarize it works on top of Slack as its plugin.

## How it works

We use [TextRank](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf) to extract important sentences from the chat text. It tokenizes the text into sentences and builds a graph with the sentences as nodes, assigning them same scores. Sentences are then ranked by recursively; a sentence 1 points to another sentence 2 when they have similar features. A score is assigned to 2 taking in account the scores of sentences that pointed to 1. Lastly, sentences are ranked in decreasing order.
